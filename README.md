# House Price Prediction Project

Demonstrate end-to-end skills in data scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. The task involves predicting house prices using machine learning models. The following requirements outline the project details.

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models. It involves data scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset collected from the website https://batdongsan.vn/ban-nha/.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Collection:
   - Scraping and collecting data items from https://batdongsan.vn/ban-nha/ to create the dataset.
   - Exploring the website thoroughly to gather relevant information on each data item.
   - Determining the size of the dataset to be collected.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
   - Selecting appropriate data features for training the models.
   - Performing necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   - Conducting feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the selected features.

3. Methodology:
   - Visualizing a heatmap based on the address of the listed house using kernel density estimation at a certain time.
   - Designing a methodology to address the house price prediction problem.
   - Considering various approaches and techniques for data analysis and modeling.
   - Justifying the chosen methodologies and explaining their effectiveness.
   - Recommending models such as Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression, Decision Tree/Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Encouraging exploration of advanced models, preferably using the PyTorch framework for deep learning models.
   - Choosing relevant metrics for model evaluation.
   - Performing model benchmarks and identifying the best model for the problem if multiple models are employed.

4. Implementation and Reporting:
   - Implementing the algorithms using Jupyter Notebook.
   - Writing a comprehensive report in both Vietnamese and English.
   - Including a detailed explanation of the implementation process and any challenges faced.
   - Demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the selected models and techniques.

## Submission

Please submit the following:

1. Jupyter Notebook:
   - Contains the implementation code and documentation.
   - Demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. Dataset:
   - Provide the dataset used for the project in a zip file.
